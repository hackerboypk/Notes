<<<Single node kubernate Clustor using minikube>> only use in developement or learning purpose not used in production
======
Install miniqube
for windows > check systeminfo >> Hyper -v Requirements should be all yes
download minikube for windows minikube-windows-amd64.exe
install kubectl
create folder in c drive with kubernates and paste downloaded minikube and kubectl
copy path c:/kubernates
advance system setting set environment varible user variable path and paste location
done
rename file in c:/kubernates minkube-windows-amd64.exe to minikube
now run command minikube
it will show the help menu

minikube start >> it will create vm in which kubernate cluster will be setup
done 
kubernates are setup in vm 
kubectl >> kubernates client which help to run commands or operations on kubernate clustor
kubectl get pods >> it will show the pods running
minikube ip >> it will show ip of our running minikube vm
minikube ssh >> it will give ssh access
minikube ssh username = docker
minikube ssh password = tcuser
how to provide dashboard to minikube >> minikube dashboard  command
=======================================================================================
session2
3-node kubernates clustor in vm
we need kubernates master, k8 worker1, k8 worker2. 3 virtual machines
all vm have at least 2 cpu 
all vm are in same network should be able to ping each other
go to vm file preferences>network>addnetwork>network name>ok
vm node setting network selct from list
check ip address of all vms and note down
ssh all 3 vm in ubuntu or kali or wsl this node must be able to ping all 3 vms
ssh username@ip enter then password
every node must have swapoff
to check free -h in all 3 nodes
to disable or off swap > swapoff -a try as root user
this is temporary to make it permananat we need to add in fstab
vim /etc/fstab
commet all lines start with swap in all nodes
we need to install docker in all 3 nodes but note that we should check which version
of docker is supported by k8s to check that follow k8s documentation
install docker in all vms version 19.
sudo cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid this should be unique in all node
iptables for ubuntu 19.04 or later  
*sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl

*sudo curl -fsSLo /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

*echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

*sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

do this in all nodes



master setup using kubeadm

kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16

kubectl get nodes to show the nodes in my cluster 
it will not work we need to enter commands to start our cluster
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernates/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(is -g) $HOME/.kube/config

kubectl get nodes >> it will show our nodes in clustor

get pods -A

kubectl apply funnel networking 
get pods -A

kubeadm join wali command copy and paste in worker nodes

kubectl get nodes on master to check all nodes are ready or not
